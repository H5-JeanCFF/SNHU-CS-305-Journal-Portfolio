# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address? 

The client, Artemis Financial, deals with sensitive financial information internationally. They wanted to address issues related to secure communication, compliance with regulations, and defense against cyber threats. 

# What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing? 

I conducted thorough manual and static testing to identify vulnerabilities in the software. Implementing input validation, upgrading outdated dependencies, and adopting secure coding practices were prioritized. Secure coding is important as it prevents data breaches, protects sensitive information, and maintains trust with clients. 

# What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you? 

The list of vulnerabilities identified through static testing was both challenging and helpful. It highlighted the importance of staying updated on dependencies and implementing security patches promptly. 

# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use? 

I increased security layers by upgrading vulnerable dependencies, implementing input validation mechanisms, and adopting secure coding practices. For future assessments, I would use automated vulnerability scanners, such as OWASP, and security practices to identify and mitigate risks efficiently. 

# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities? 

After refactoring the code, I conducted testing to ensure both functionality and security. I used techniques like code reviews to identify any vulnerabilities during the refactoring process. 

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks? 

I utilized vulnerability databases like NVD, security frameworks, and coding best practices to address security concerns. These resources and practices will be beneficial for future assignments, ensuring security measures are in place. 

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment? 

For future employers, I can showcase my ability to conduct vulnerability assessments, implement effective security measures, and ensure the functionality of software applications. Finally, I can demonstrate proficiency in using security tools and adherence to industry best practices, maintaining secure and reliable software systems.
